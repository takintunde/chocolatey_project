## What is Chocolatey? ##
Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows. It allows users to install and manage software in a similar way to how apt-get or yum works on Linux, or Homebrew on macOS. With Chocolatey, users can install, upgrade, and remove software using the command line, and it also provides a way to automate software installations and upgrades in a Windows environment.

## How is Chocolatey installed? ##
Chocolatey can be installed on a Windows machine by running the following command in an administrative command prompt:

```
@"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"
```

This command downloads the Chocolatey installation script and runs it with administrative permissions. Once Chocolatey is installed, the `choco` command can be used to manage packages.

Please note that you need to have PowerShell version 3 or later installed, and you should run the command prompt as administrator

## How do you install Chocolatey packages? (example: Notepad++) ##

To install a package using Chocolatey, open a command prompt or PowerShell window with administrator privileges and type the command `choco install [package name]`. For example, to install the Notepad++ package, you would run: 
```
choco install notepadplusplus
```


You can also use `choco upgrade [package name]` to upgrade a package that is already installed.

If you want to install a specific version of a package, you can use the command `choco install [package name] --version [version number]`.

You can also use `choco list --local-only` to see the list of all the packages installed locally.

## How can you use Puppet to deploy a Chocolatey package? ##

To use Puppet to deploy a Chocolatey package, you can create a Puppet module that includes a Chocolatey resource type. This resource type can be used to manage the installation and configuration of Chocolatey packages on your nodes.

Here is an example of how to use the Chocolatey resource type in a Puppet module:
```
class mymodule::chocolatey {
  package { 'mypackage':
    ensure   => 'latest',
    provider => chocolatey,
  }
}
```
In this example, the `mymodule::chocolatey` class installs the latest version of the `mypackage` package using the Chocolatey package provider.

You can also use the `chocolatey_package` resource type
```
chocolatey_package { 'mypackage':
  ensure => present,
}
```
This will install the package "mypackage" using chocolatey package manager.

You can then include this class in your site manifest to apply it to your nodes, or use the `class` or `include` function to include the class in other Puppet classes or modules.

You will also need to ensure that the Chocolatey package manager is installed on your nodes before using the Chocolatey resource type. You can use the `chocolatey` package provider to install Chocolatey, or use the `chocolatey_config` resource type to configure the Chocolatey package manager.

You can then use Puppet to ensure that the package is installed, configured and running according to your desired state.

## How would you store Chocolatey package information in Hiera? ##
In order to store Chocolatey package information in Hiera, you would create a new YAML file in your Hiera configuration directory (usually located at /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/hieradata/) and give it a meaningful name, such as "chocolatey_packages.yaml".

In this file, you would define a series of key-value pairs, where the key is the name of the Chocolatey package and the value is a hash containing information about the package, such as its version and any additional options that should be passed to the Chocolatey install command.

An example of what this file might look like is:
```
chocolatey_packages:
  notepadplusplus:
    ensure: present
    version: 7.9.1
  git:
    ensure: present
    version: 2.29.2
```
Then, in your Puppet manifest, you would use the Hiera function to lookup the package information and pass it to the Chocolatey package resource.
```
$chocolatey_packages = hiera('chocolatey_packages')
create_resources(chocolatey_package, $chocolatey_packages)
```

## How could you deploy the Chocolatey client on servers using Puppet? ##
To deploy the Chocolatey client on servers using Puppet, you can use the puppetlabs/chocolatey module. This module allows you to manage Chocolatey and its packages on Windows systems.

To install the module, you can use the puppet module install command:
```
puppet module install puppetlabs/chocolatey
```
Once the module is installed, you can use the chocolatey class to install Chocolatey on your servers. Here is an example of how you can use the class in your Puppet manifest:
```
class { 'chocolatey':
  chocolatey_license => 'accept',
}
```
You can also use the chocolatey::package to install package using choco.
```
chocolatey::package { 'notepadplusplus': }
```
This will install the Notepad++ package using choco package manager.

You can then use Puppet to manage the configuration and installation of packages managed by Chocolatey.
```
chocolatey::config { 'cacheLocation':
  value => 'C:\\Chocolatey',
}
```
This will configure the cache location for chocolatey package to "C:\Chocolatey"

You can then use the puppet apply command to apply your manifest and install Chocolatey on your servers.
```
puppet apply your_manifest.pp
```

## How would you suggest we host our own Chocolatey server? ##
Hosting your own Chocolatey server involves setting up a web server to host the Chocolatey packages and configuring it to work with the Chocolatey client on client machines. Here are the general steps you can follow to set up your own Chocolatey server:

1. Install a web server software, such as IIS or Apache, on the server machine that will host the Chocolatey packages.

2. Configure the web server to allow for file uploads and to serve the packages as static files.

3. Create a directory on the server machine to store the Chocolatey packages.

4. Create a Chocolatey package feed by creating an XML file that lists the packages available on the server.

5. Upload the packages to the server and add them to the package feed.

6. Configure the client machines to use the custom package feed by modifying the Chocolatey configuration file on each machine.

7. Test the setup by installing a package from the custom feed on a client machine.

>Note: Keep in mind that there are also other alternatives such as using a pre-built package repository servers like ProGet or MyGet.

## Do we need to have a separate dev and pro? What would the advantages be? ##
Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows that allows you to install and manage software from the command line. It is typically used in a development environment to manage dependencies and automate software installations.

Whether or not you need a separate development and production environment for Chocolatey depends on your specific use case. In general, it is a good idea to have separate environments for development and production to ensure that changes made in development are thoroughly tested before being deployed to production.

If you are using Chocolatey to manage software dependencies for a specific project, it may be beneficial to have a separate development environment where you can test and debug any issues with the software dependencies before deploying them to production.

On the other hand, if you are using Chocolatey to manage software installations across your entire organization, it may be more beneficial to have a single environment for managing software installations, as changes made in one environment will likely affect all users.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to have separate environments for Chocolatey will depend on the specific needs of your organization and the way that Chocolatey is being used.
